2 - Fizz Buzz
Write a function that returns the string representation of all numbers from 1 to n based on the following rules:

* If it's a multiple of 3, represent it as "fizz".
* If it's a multiple of 5, represent it as "buzz".
* If it's a multiple of both 3 and 5, represent it as "fizzbuzz".
* If it's neither, just return the number itself.


function fizzBuzz(n) {
    let finalArr = [];

    for (let=1; i <= n; i++) {

        if (n % 3 === 0 & n % 5 === 0) {
            finalArr.push('fizzbuzz')
        } else if ( i % 3 === 0) {
            finalArr.push('fizz')
        } else if ( i % 5 === 0) {
            finalArr.push('buzz');
        } else {
            finalarr.push(i.toString());
        }
    }
}
